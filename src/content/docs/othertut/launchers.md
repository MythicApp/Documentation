# Text Guide
## Installing the Steam setup file
To install the `SteamSetup.exe` file, click [here](https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/client/installer/SteamSetup.exe) and the official Steam installer will download for Windows to your device.
## Importing the setup file into Mythic
Once the `SteamSetup.exe` file is installed, navigate to your Mythic library and press the `+` in the top right corner to start importing the setup file.

### Changing attributes about the installer import
Press `Local` and change the native platform to `Windows` and then make the name whatever you want to, for this, I am going to name is `Steam Installer`. Open the `SteamSetup.exe` file in the `Where is the game located?` section of the import menu.

Press `Done` when you are done filling out the menu.

Locate whatever you named the installer as in your library.
## Install Steam
Once located, press the play button on the cover for the installer.

It may take a second but it will open up a window prompting you to install Steam. It will ask you your language and where you want to install it. Please use the default directory for the simplicity of following along.

Wait until Steam is finished installing and when it is done a checkbox will be shown asking if you want to `Run Steam` when the installer is closed, uncheck this box and exit the installer.

## Uninstalling the installer (optional)
If you no longer want the installer inside of your Mythic library, locate the installer inside of the library and press the trash bin icon with the `X` inside of it and press `Uninstall`. A restart of Mythic may need to happen for your changes to be in effect.
## Import Steam directory
Now we are going to import the actual Steam directory into Mythic so you can open Steam through Mythic.

Navigate back to the Local import menu.

Fill in the game name, I will name this `Steam` for this guide, and then choose the native platform, `Windows`.

I will then choose the directory Steam is located in, if you stuck with the default, press `Browse` and then press `Command + Shift + G` on your keyboard and type in the following path, `(Your User)/Library/Containers/Mythic/Bottles/(Your Bottle Name)/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam` and then press `Open` and then once you're finished customizing the import attributes, press `Done`

**Replace the *"Your Name"* and the *"Your Bottle Name"* with your username for your Mac and the name of the bottle Steam is located in.**
## Opening Steam
Once you have done all of that, locate Steam in your Mythic library and press the play button for it to launch, you will need to sign in to your Steam account upon first launch.

After this, you can install and play games as if they were running
