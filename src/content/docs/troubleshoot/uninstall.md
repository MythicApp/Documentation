title: Uninstalling and Reinstalling Mythic
---
To uninstall Mythic while keeping all of your data inside of Mythic, simply locate the `Mythic.app` file, this should be inside of your Applications folder for maxmimum performance but it also works in your desriable directory.

To fully uninstall Mythic, including your Bottle and your user info, we recommend [AppCleaner](appcleanerlinkhere).

Simply drag the `Mythic.app` file into AppCleaner and let it locate all traces of Mythic on your device.

Once it has done so, press `Remove`, if an error appears saying it doesn't have permission to remove some files, look for the highlighted.
