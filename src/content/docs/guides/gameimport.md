`Select a game:`, the game has to be inside of your Epic Games library, so, select the game you are importing.

`Choose the game's native platform:`, Mythic is not only a game launcher for Windows game but also a game launcher for Mac games as well, so if the game has a native port for Mac, you can select that here but you can also select Windows.

`Where is the game located?`, this is asking where the game is located, click on the `Browse` button to the right of this screen and locate the base game **folder** where the game is, inside of Finder.

`Import with DLCs`, if you have installed DLCs to the game you are importing, toggle this on so Mythic understands that and launches the game with them.

`Verify the game's integrity`, to make sure the files are up to date and haven't been deleted, created, or other tampers have been done to them, toggle this on so Mythic can compare the folder to what it knows.

When finished checking over this menu, press the `Done` button for Mythic to add this to your library and it can now be launched and played, using Mythic.

## Local Game Import
If you have another game, that isn't an Epic Games game, installed to your device such as a DRM-free, other launcher game, or a ~~pirated~~ game on your device, you can import it here.
