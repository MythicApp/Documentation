## Meet the Mythic Docs.

The best way to learn how to play Windows games on Mac.

Mythic is an open-source macOS game launcher to play Windows games through our implementation of Apple's Game Porting Toolkit - supporting many launchers.

What makes Mythic different from Apps like Whisky and Crossover? Those apps require a little knowledge in some Windows Mac features that an ordinary user wouldn't know how to do.

Mythic is a streamlined version of these apps and does the rest for you, all you need to do is download/import games and then launch them. If you're not sure what to do, go to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/GwHgX3QWK3) or read the rest of the docs.
