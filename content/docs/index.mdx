What makes Mythic different from Apps like Whisky and Crossover? Those apps require a little knowledge in Windows and some Mac features that an ordinary user wouldn't know how to do.

Mythic is a streamlined version of these apps and does the rest for you, all you need to do is download/import games and then launch them. If you're not sure what to do, go to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/GwHgX3QWK3) or read the rest of the docs.
