title: Creating a bottle

Creating a bottle is recommended when having multiple apps installed but you would have another bottle so their files don't conflict with each other.

# Locating the correct screen

This is the screen you will need to navigate to.
To create the bottle, press the '+' icon in the top right next to the folder icon.
Once you press that, you will have two options to change (if you want to.)

`Choose a name for your bottle:`, this will be the name of your bottle and how Mythic wil refer to it as.

`Where do you want the bottle's path to be located?`, this is where all of the bottles files will be located on your Mac.
Once you are done configurating your bottle, press the `Done` button in the bottom right of the pop-up menu.
You can now see your bottle inside of the Wine/Bottles menu, if you can't see it immediately after leaving the `Create a bottle` menu, switch to another menu on the sidebar and go back to the Wine/Bottles menu and it will appear.
