title: Game installation quits instantly.

This can be caused by multiple issues and is easy to fix.

## Insufficient Disk Space
Your download will quit instantly if you have insufficient space on the drive you are installing your game on.

To fix this, free up space on your drive and reattempt the download. If it quits again, it could be another problem addressed in this page.

## Installing a DLC instead of base game
Your download will also quit instantly if you are downloading the DLC to a game instead of the main game.

To fix this, find the main game instead of the DLC in your Mythic library and install the main game and then the DLC.
