title: Managing the Mythic.app file
---
## Basic Uninstall
To uninstall Mythic while keeping all of your data inside of Mythic, simply locate the `Mythic.app` file, this should be inside of your Applications folder but works anywhere else, then when it is located, simply drag it to the trash and delete it from there.

## Full Uninstall
To fully uninstall Mythic, including your bottles and your user info, we recommend [AppCleaner](appcleanerlinkhere).

Open AppCleaner and then simply drag the `Mythic.app` file into AppCleaner and let it locate all traces of Mythic on your device.

Once it has done so, press `Remove`. Then, delete the files from the trash.

If an error appears saying it doesn't have permission to remove some files, look for the files still with a blue checkmark and then press the magnifying glass to the right of it and then delete the highlighted file/folder that opens in Finder.
