Once Mythic is launched, as we did in the previous steps, press the arrow to continue

When Mythic opens your browser, sign into Epic Games and locate the `"authorizationCode":"[yourauthcode]` and copy it to your clipboard and then paste it into the text area in Mythic.

When continuing, it should welcome your Epic Games account name and then it will want you to Install the Mythic Engine, press the very left arrow.

It will then download and install, and then it will setup the default bottle that Mythic will use.

When it's finished, it will say "You're all set" and then press the arrow to continue.

Mythic has now set up and games can be downloaded.
