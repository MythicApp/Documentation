You can contribute to Mythic in many ways.

## Language Localization

We use an app called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) which is used for software and websites to be contributed by adding support for different languages so people who use Mythic and those languages can use it with no struggle.

## Game Experience Report

We have a spreadsheet with a Google Form linked at the top so people can report their experiences with games with a variety of factors involved.

## Code Contribution

Mythic is an open-source app that is published on GitHub and all of the code can be viewed there but can also be edited when the repository is forked. Mythic is coded in Swift, Apple's proprietary language for apps. When you make changes on the fork, make sure to sync branch often and create a pull request so we can add it to Mythic.

## Donate

Donating is one of most useful things you can do to support Mythic. They have been used to make Mythic notarized with Apple (hasn't been implemented yet) and more to expand Mythic.
