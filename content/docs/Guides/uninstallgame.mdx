When you have found the game you want to uninstall, at the bottom of the cover art for the game, press the icon with an `X` and a trash bin and press it.

A menu will appear with two options.

## Uninstall Options

`Remove game files`, this will (when toggled on) keep the game files for the game inside of `~/Applications/Games/Mythic` and show up as uninstalled in Mythic.

`Run specialised uninstaller (If applicable)`, this will (if your game or app has one), run the uninstaller for it so it deletes all the related files that it installed.

Toggle these if you need to or want to, once you have toggled (or didn't), press `Uninstall` and your game will now be uninstalled.
