# Text Guide
This is only the installation of Mythic
To install Mythic, download it from the [Github](https://github.com/MythicApp/Mythic/releases).
Scroll down to assets and expand the menu

Click on `Mythic.zip` and locate it in Finder

Double click on it so it extracts the `Mythic.app` file from it.

Drag that into the Applications folder

Open the `Mythic.app` file from the Applications folder

You will then be prompted that Apple couldn't verify whether Mythic was safe. To get past this, proceed to System Settings and on the sidebar, go to Privacy and Security.

When there, scroll all the way down to where it says `"Mythic.app" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.` and to the side of that, press Open Anyway. 

Press Open Anyway again.

The reason this appears is because Mythic isn't notarized yet, this has already been paid, just not implemented quite yet.

And now, Mythic should open and needed to be set up.
