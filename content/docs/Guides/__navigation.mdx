This page is for navigating each page linked in the Mythic sidebar.

## Home

<Image alt="Homepage" src="/mhome.png" width={750} height={750} />
Home appears when Mythic is launched.

It shows you your favorite games and all of your bottles. It also shows you your most recently played game.

## Library

<Image alt="Library" src="/mlibrary.png" width={750} height={750} />
The library shows all of your Epic Games games, if you decided to sign in, but it
also shows your imported games if you've done that.

## Game Installation

<Image alt="gameinstallmenu" src="/mgameinstall.png" width={750} height={750} />
This is just a **guide to the UI** of installing a game. To see how to install a
game, go to Game Installation in the sidebar on the left.

Once you found an Epic Gams game to download, a menu will pop up.
On this page menu, there are 2 options you have.

`Where do you want the game's base path to be located?` which is where the game will be located, the default location is `~/Applications/Games/Mythic/[yourgamehere]`. You can either keep this to the default or change it to whatever folder or external drive you want it to be.

The next option is `Choose the game's native platform:` and Mythic is a game launcher for all platforms, not just Windows so if the game is a native Mac game, you can select that here but you can also download the Windows version.

## Game Importing

### Epic Games Import

<Image alt="gameimportmenu" src="/mepicimport.png" width={750} height={750} />
This is meant for Epic Games games that are already installed with apps such as Heroic
Launcher or Whisky. This menu consists of many options.

`Select a game`, this is selecting the game that you are importing.

`Choose the game's native platform`, when the game is installed already, choose what platform the game is.

`Where is the game located`, choose where the game is located on your device or external drive so Mythic knows where to open it from.

`Import with DLCs`, if the game has installed DLCs, toggle this on so Mythic can have the DLCs in your imported game.

`Verify the game's integrity`, this is to make sure your imported game folder has all of the correct files to make sure the game isn't broken or missing dependencies.

### Local Game Import

<Image alt="localimport" src="/mlocalimport.png" width={750} height={750} />
This is meant for all other games that aren't from Epic Games, such as DRM-free platforms,
other game launchers, and ~~pirated~~ games.

`What should we call this game?`, the name Mythic will use for this game.

`Choose the game's native platform:` as Mythic is a game launcher for MacOS and Windows, not just Windows, it needs to know what native platform it should run it as.

`Where is the game located?`, so Mythic knows where the game is located at.

`Enter thumbnail URL here... (optional)`, this is the cover art that will appear in your library and if this isn't filled it, it will use the icon of the imported game, most likely a folder icon.

## Game Settings

<Image alt="gamesettings" src="/mgameset.png" width={750} height={750} />
To change certain aspects or to manage parts of your game.

`Retina Mode`, sharpens your game for better fidelity and makes it look more crisp and will make blurry resolutions look better.

`Enchanced Sync (MSync)`, improves FPS in more CPU-reliant games and boosts performance based to stock Wine.

`Windows Version`, very important option you have which can change the compatibility of some games and can be changed with no limit and the only downside would be your game being incompatibile with the version.

## Store

<Image alt="storefront" src="/mstore.png" width={750} height={750} />
The store, this is an embed of the Epic Games Store website where you can purchase
games that are on the Epic Games Store and manage your account.

You can turn on the `Performance HUD` which gives you information about how your game is running such as FPS and graphs.

`Retina Mode` sharpens your game for better fidelity and makes it look more crisp and will make blurry resolutions look better.

You can also turn on `Enhanced Sync (MSync)` which improves FPS in more CPU-reliant games and boosts performance based to stock Wine.

The last option is your `Windows Version`, this is a very important option you have which can change the compatibility of some games and can be changed with no limit and the only downside would be your game being incompatibile with the version.

At the bottom of this menu, you have 4 options, `Open...`, `Launch Winetricks`, `Launch Configurator`, and `Launch Registry Editor`.

The `Open...` button allows you to open an `.exe` file which this button would most likely be used for portable apps or application setup files such as `SteamSetup.exe` or `UbisoftConnectInstaller.exe` and wouldn't need to be imported and could be opened from here.

The `Launch Winetricks` button is a work in progress but will maximize the compatibility for many apps and games.

The `Launch Configurator` button opens up a window to change many more options about your bottle, such as, Drives, Audio, and Graphics.

The `Launch Registry Editor` button allows you to change keys on your Windows bottle. Do NOT mess with anything in here unless you absolutely know what you're doing.
